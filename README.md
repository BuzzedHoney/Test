###  Edge, Outlook, and OneDrive Remover

The **Edge\&OORemover.ps1** script is the most aggressive, complete removal method for Microsoft bloatware.

####  Edge

* Force-uninstalls Edge using setup.exe with `--force-uninstall`
* Kills EdgeUpdate and EdgeCore
* Deletes services, folders, registry keys, and all shortcuts
* Rebuilds folder structure and applies **deny ACLs** so Microsoft can't reinstall it

####  Outlook

* Terminates all Outlook processes
* Removes UWP & desktop versions
* Deletes app data, registry keys, and start menu/desktop shortcuts
* Erases any trace of Outlook from WindowsApps

####   OneDrive

* Terminates all OneDrive instances
* Uninstalls via `OneDriveSetup.exe`
* Deletes OneDrive folders, start menu shortcuts, and registry keys
* Cleans leftover cloud sync links

It’s a [killshot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxQTY-W6GIo) for Microsoft’s most persistent shitware.
